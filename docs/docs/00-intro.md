Print Crew is a community-driven Chrome extension that transforms web pages into printer-friendly versions. With our extension, you can apply custom print styles to websites—ensuring that when you print a page, it looks clean, organized, and professional.

## What Does Print Crew Do?

- **Custom Print Styles:**  
  Applies tailored CSS rules using `@media print` to optimize pages for printing.
- **Community Contributions:**  
  Empowering users to contribute new site-specific print styles via pull requests.
- **Developer-Friendly:**  
  Provides detailed guides for modifying the extension, updating the `manifest.json`, adding new CSS files, and testing with Chrome’s Developer Tools.
- **Real-Time Testing:**  
  Leverage Chrome's "Print to PDF" feature and live editing in Developer Tools to preview your changes instantly.

- Enhance the print experience for countless users.
- Improve the overall quality and accessibility of online content.
- Build a collaborative resource for developers and enthusiasts alike.
