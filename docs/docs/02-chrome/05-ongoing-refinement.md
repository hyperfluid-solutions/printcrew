title: Encouraging Ongoing Refinement
---

Continuous experimentation and iteration are key to achieving the perfect print layout.

## Tips for Ongoing Refinement

- **Experiment Continuously:** Use DevTools to make quick, live changes. Test different print layouts until you achieve the desired result.
- **Leverage Shortcuts:** Utilize keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl+Shift+I` and `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or their macOS equivalents) to streamline your workflow.
- **Iterative Testing:** Regularly toggle between screen and print views to ensure your design is optimized for both.
- **Document Changes:** Keep track of your modifications in your source files. This makes future updates easier and maintains a clear design history.
