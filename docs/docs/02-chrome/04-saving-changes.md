title: Saving Your Changes
---

Changes made directly in DevTools are temporary. To save them permanently, follow these steps:

## Updating Your Source Files Manually

1. **Copy** your modified CSS rules from the DevTools **Styles** pane.
2. **Paste** them into your actual CSS file using your favorite code editor.
3. **Save** the file and refresh your webpage to confirm the changes.

## Using Chrome Workspaces (Optional)

Chrome Workspaces allows you to map local files to those served by your web server, enabling you to save changes directly from DevTools.

1. Open the **Sources** panel.
2. Click the **gear icon (⚙️)** to access **Settings**.
3. Under **Workspaces**, click **Add Folder** and select your project folder.
4. Map the network resources to your local files.
5. Now, changes you make in DevTools will automatically update your local files.
